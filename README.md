### From Androids notes on Nougats new notifications features


In Android 7.0 we've redesigned notifications to make them easier and faster to use. Some of the changes include:

* Template updates: We're updating notification templates to put a new emphasis on hero image and avatar. Developers will be able to take advantage of the new templates with minimal adjustments in their code.

* Messaging style customization: You can customize more of the user interface labels associated with your notifications using the MessagingStyle class. You can configure the message, conversation title, and content view.

* Bundled notifications: The system can group messages together, for example by message topic, and display the group. A user can take actions, such as Dismiss or Archive, on them in place. If you’ve implemented notifications for Android Wear, you’ll already be familiar with this model.

* Direct reply: For real-time communication apps, the Android system supports inline replies so that users can quickly respond to an SMS or text message directly within the notification interface.

* Custom views: Two new APIs enable you to leverage system decorations, such as notification headers and actions, when using custom views in notifications.
